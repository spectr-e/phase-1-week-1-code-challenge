# MORINGA SCHOOL: PHASE (1) ONE
## WEEK (1) ONE TOY PROBLEMS
### Prerequisites
1. Create a repository on your GitHub account. 

    *NB: One folder, with 3-4 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution.*

2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.

    **NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges.**

### Challenge 1 - Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 
>    *A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.*

### Challenge 2 - Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
>    *For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.*

### Challenge 3 - Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
>    *NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the links below.*

### Challenge 4 - Extra Practice Questions
#### Challenge 4a - (BubbleSort)
1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input. It should output an array of those same numbers sorted from lowest to highest.

>*sample input = [5,6,1,3,4,2]*
>*Expected output = [1,2,3,4,5,6]*

**Research Areas:**
1. Loops 
2. Array Methods 

#### Challenge 4b - (Loops)
2. Staircase problem 
Create a function that takes an integer and console logs a step shaped stair with the integer levels using the # character 

>*e.g steps(2)  #*
>              *##*
>    *steps(3)  #*
>              *##*
>              *###*

**Research Areas**

#### Challenge 4c - (Objects)
3. Write a JavaScript program to get the volume of a Cylinder with four decimal places using object classes.
Volume of a cylinder : 
>    *V = πr2h where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.*

**Research Areas** 
1. Objects. 
2. Object constructor.
